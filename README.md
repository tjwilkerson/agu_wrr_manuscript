# Improving River Slope Estimation in Noisy SWOT Data

This repository contains the analysis and figure creation code used for the manuscript:  

**_Improving River Slope Estimation in Noisy SWOT Water Surface Elevation Data Using Quantile-Based Filtering_**

---

## Overview
This work focuses on developing a **quantile-based filtering approach** to improve slope estimation from noisy SWOT water surface elevation (WSE) data.  
The methods presented here aim to preserve individual point-level information in the SWOT Pixel Cloud (PIXC) product, while removing outliers that bias discharge calculations.

## Datasets
- **GNSS Field Data**  
  Collected on the **Río Petrohué, Chile**, concurrent with SWOT overpasses.  
- **SWOT Pixel Cloud (PIXC) Product**  
  The experimental WSE dataset derived from SWOT radar interferometry.
